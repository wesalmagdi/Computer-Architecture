# Computer Architecture Project

Welcome to the **Computer Architecture** repository. This project focuses on the design, simulation, and implementation of core computing components, exploring how hardware and software interface to execute instructions.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project involves the development of a functional architecture (likely MIPS, RISC-V, or a Custom Instruction Set). It covers the fundamental building blocks of a CPU, including:
* **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit):** Performing operations like ADD, SUB, AND, OR.
* **Control Unit:** Decoding instructions and managing data flow.
* **Datapath:** The "highways" that connect registers, memory, and the ALU.
* **Register File:** High-speed storage for operand processing.

## 🛠️ Built With
* **Language/Tool:** [Verilog]
* **Simulation:** [Vivado]
* **Architecture:** [64-bit RIS]

## 📂 Project Structure
The repository is organized by individual module files and their corresponding testbenches. Each file is named based on the component and the contributor responsible for its design:

* **Component Files:** Implementation of the ALU, Control Unit, Register File, and Datapath logic.
* **Testbench Files:** Verification scripts to test the logic of each specific hardware module.
* **Documentation:** Schematics and technical reports are located in the main directory or specific docs files.


## 📊 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
This architecture supports the following instruction types:
- **R-Type:** Arithmetic operations (ADD, SUB, etc.)
- **I-Type:** Immediate operations and memory access (LW, SW)
- **J-Type:** Control flow (JUMP, BEQ)
- **S-Type:** Memory Stores (SD)
