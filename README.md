# Computer Architecture Project

Welcome to the **Computer Architecture** repository. This project focuses on the design, simulation, and implementation of core computing components, exploring how hardware and software interface to execute instructions.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project involves the development of a functional architecture (likely MIPS, RISC-V, or a Custom Instruction Set). It covers the fundamental building blocks of a CPU, including:
* **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit):** Performing operations like ADD, SUB, AND, OR.
* **Control Unit:** Decoding instructions and managing data flow.
* **Datapath:** The "highways" that connect registers, memory, and the ALU.
* **Register File:** High-speed storage for operand processing.

## 🛠️ Built With
* **Language/Tool:** [Verilog]
* **Simulation:** [Vivado]
* **Architecture:** [64-bit RIS]

## 📁 Key Components
* `/src`: Contains the source code for the hardware modules.
* `/testbench`: Scripts and files used to verify the logic of the design.
* `/docs`: Documentation regarding the instruction set and schematics.



## 📊 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
This architecture supports the following instruction types:
- **R-Type:** Arithmetic operations (ADD, SUB, etc.)
- **I-Type:** Immediate operations and memory access (LW, SW)
- **J-Type:** Control flow (JUMP, BEQ)
